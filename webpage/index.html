					<h3>Participant Information</h3>

					<p>Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part in this research. If you are happy to participate you will be asked to sign a consent form.  Your participation is completely voluntary. </p>

					<p><strong>What is the research about?</strong>

					This is a research project which aims to study the use of Linked Data in Q&A system like StackOverflow. This research is to see if you can use Linked Data and semantic search to find and improve the search of answers to the unanswered questions in the question and answering websites. The study is funded by University of Southampton. At the end of the study, you will receive an email with the link to a website where you can see the study findings and see how your data was used. </p>

					<p><strong>Why have I been chosen?</strong>  You have been approached because you are part of a randomly selected sample. </p>

					<p><strong>What will happen to me if I take part?</strong>  You will be taken to the iSurvey website where you will find 15 programming related questions. Each question is divided into 3 parts. You will be asked to rate keywords (in part 1 and 2 of question), and answer (part 3 of question). It will take about 30-40 minutes to finish this questionnaire. </p>


					<p> <strong>Are there any benefits in my taking part?</strong>  It is expected that the study will add to current knowledge about sematic search and use of linked data in question and answering systems.</p>

					<p><strong>Are there any risks involved?</strong>  There are no particular risks associated with your participation. </p>

					<p> <strong>Will my data be confidential? </strong>  All data collected will be held on a password protected computer and secure University server, and used only in accordance with the Data Protection Act (1998).  In addition, the data will be anonymized by separating identifying data.  Your data will be linked to your consent form by your email address.  It will destroyed by the end July, 2015. If you would like to access your data after your participation, change it, or withdraw it, please contact the investigator, Priyanka Singh(<a href="mailto:ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk">ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk</a>), who will arrange this. </p>

					<p> <strong>What happens if I change my mind? </strong>  You may withdraw at any time and for any reason.  You may withdraw your data at any time and for any reason prior to its destruction. </p>

					<p> <strong>What happens if something goes wrong? </strong>  Should you have any concern or complaint, contact me if possible (<a href="mailto:ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk">ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk</a>), otherwise please contact the FPSE Office or any other authoritative body such as Head of Research Governance (02380 595058). </p>

					<h3>Instructions</h3>

					<p> <strong>How to participate in this experiment?</strong></p>

					<p>In this survey you will be shown three types of questions:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Questions to rate the quality of the keywords generated by StackOverflow users.</li>
						<li>Questions to rate the quality of the keywords generated by the system.</li>
						<li>Questions to rate the quality of the answers generated by the system.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You will be asked to rate the quality of the keywords and answers. </p>

					<p> <strong>Purpose of the research:</strong> To find similar answered questions to unanswered questions in StackOverflow </p>
					
					<p> <strong>Purpose of keywords rating:</strong> To check the quality of the keywords generated by the system.</p>

					<p> <strong>Purpose of answers rating:</strong> To check the quality of the answers recommended by the system.</p>

					<p> <strong>Note: </p> </strong>
					<ul>
						<li>The <strong>quality of the answers varies</strong> (good, medium, bad). Please use your best judgement to rate these answers.</li>
						<li>You <strong>don't need to know the exact answer </strong>to the question. Please use your <strong>best judgement to rate</strong> the answers and keywords.</li>
						<li>Please <strong>don't Google the question</strong> as it might show you StackOverflow result and it's rating might influence your rating.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>If you have any question, you can email me at <a href="mailto:ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk">ps1w07@ecs.soton.ac.uk</a> and I will get back to you. </p>
